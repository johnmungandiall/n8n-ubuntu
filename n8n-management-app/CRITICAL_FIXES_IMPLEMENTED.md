**Validation:** All errors now follow consistent patterns with proper logging.

### âœ… BUG-010: Resource Cleanup Failure (FIXED)
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Impact:** Background threads continue running after window close  
**Solution:** Implemented proper resource cleanup with graceful shutdown

**Implementation:**
- Added `shutdown_event` for coordinated thread termination
- Implemented `_cleanup_resources()` method
- Added thread tracking with `background_threads` list
